# SurreyNotSorry
An Android app made by myself and several other peers at university as part of an app development project, developed exclusively for University of Surrey students.

Final snapshots of the app design can be seen here: https://www.behance.net/gallery/45448453/University-Mobile-App

Created using Java with Android Studio.
