# SurreyNotSorry
An Android app made by myself and several other peers at university as part of an app development project, developed exclusively for University of Surrey students.

Final snapshots of the app design can be seen here: https://www.behance.net/gallery/45448453/University-Mobile-App.


See releases to obtain the .apk version of the app. 
Created using Java with Android Studio.
